"""
Gym-style RL environment wrapper around fire_sim.py.

This module defines the INTERFACE the future CNN/MLP/actor-critic model code
will train against (observation format, action format, reward). It contains
no neural networks and no training loop -- reset()/step() just drive the
deterministic fire-spread cellular automaton (fire_sim.FireSim) plus simple,
explicit resource-dispatch/reward bookkeeping.

Action space
------------
action = (resource_type, target_zone) where:
  - resource_type: one of RESOURCE_TYPES ("water_team", "trench_crew",
    "rescue_vehicle", "helicopter"), or None/"noop" to dispatch nothing this
    tick.
  - target_zone: int zone id in [0, n_zones); ignored if resource_type is
    None/"noop". Zones are a coarse rectangular partition of the grid (see
    _build_zones) used ONLY to give the action space a manageable size and a
    real travel time -- it does not change what the CNN branch sees, which
    is still the full-resolution grid.

Resources dispatch from a real, multi-station LAFD roster (see
data_pipeline/real_depots.json) -- each real station carries its own roster
across possibly multiple resource types (e.g. Station 19/Brentwood carries
both a real Engine and a real Brush Patrol unit), and a resource type can
exist at more than one station (e.g. water_team units at both Station 69
and Station 37), matching how LAFD actually pools units across stations
during a real incident rather than one station being "the" source for a
resource category city-wide. _try_dispatch() picks the nearest AVAILABLE
unit of the requested type across every station that carries it -- real
"nearest unit of type X," not a fixed single depot. Station selection is
automatic/internal to dispatch, not part of the action space: the agent
still only ever picks (resource_type, target_zone), exactly as before.

The three ground types (water_team, trench_crew, rescue_vehicle) travel via
the real road graph, one Dijkstra tree per STATION (not per type -- a
station's tree is reused for every resource type in its roster). helicopter
is the odd one out: its one station (Air Operations, Van Nuys) has no road
route at all -- travel time is straight-line distance to the target divided
by a fixed cruise speed (HELICOPTER_SPEED_MPS). That is its real advantage
(it can reach zones the road graph can't, e.g. the 1 zone flagged
unreachable for ground units), traded off against a long reload period
after each drop (HELICOPTER_RELOAD_TICKS, a round trip back to Van Nuys to
refill retardant/water -- longer than the ground units' post-arrival
DEPLOYED_BUSY_TICKS) -- a helicopter is not simply a strictly-better ground
unit, matching how limited/weather-constrained real LAFD air support is.

Observation space
-----------------
obs = {
    "grid": float32 array (n_static_layers + 1, height, width) -- the 8
        static layers from grid_static.npy (see STATIC_LAYER_NAMES) stacked
        with the current per-cell fire state (fire_sim.FireSim.state, raw
        ordinal 0-4: Safe/Fuel/Threat/Blaze/Burned Out) as the last channel.
        This is the CNN branch's input.
    "scalars": OrderedDict, fixed key order given by SCALAR_KEYS -- wind
        speed/direction, humidity, resources available per type, elapsed
        ticks. This is the MLP branch's input. Use flatten_scalars(obs) to
        get a plain float32 vector in SCALAR_KEYS order once model code
        needs one.
}

Reward (see the project reward-formula spec)
---------------------------------------------
  +50  a dispatched water_team OR helicopter's arrival extinguishes >=1
       active fire cell -- a retardant/water drop is the same suppression
       action as a ground water_team, just delivered from the air, so it
       earns the same explicit positive reward term
 -100 to -400  a building cell is consumed by fire this tick
       (BUILDING_DESTROYED_PENALTY * a population-density-based multiplier,
       1x-4x -- see POPULATION_PENALTY_SCALE/_CAP -- a building lost in
       dense Westwood costs more than an identical loss on an empty
       hillside)
  10%-50% of that (population-scaled) penalty, if the building was in a
       zone a rescue_vehicle had reached first -- the waived FRACTION itself
       scales with population_density too (RESCUE_PENALTY_REDUCTION_MIN/MAX),
       so evacuating a dense area is worth more than evacuating a sparse one
  -10  a resource action has no effect: no unit of that type was available,
       OR the unit arrives but its effect can't apply (trench_crew targets a
       cell that's already on fire; water_team/rescue_vehicle/helicopter
       target a zone with nothing to put out / no one threatened)
       (RESOURCE_WASTED_PENALTY)
  -lambda * travel_time_seconds, charged once per successful dispatch
       (LAMBDA_TRAVEL_TIME)
Congestion term intentionally omitted (Tier 3, per project plan).
Only water_team and helicopter have an explicit positive reward term --
trench_crew and rescue_vehicle create value indirectly, by preventing future
-100/-10 events, matching the reward terms specified in the project plan (no
extra terms invented here).
